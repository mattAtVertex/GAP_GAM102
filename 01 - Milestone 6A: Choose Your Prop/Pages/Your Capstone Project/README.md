<h2>Capstone Prop Process</h2>
<h3>Step 1: Pick a Prop</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to do is pick a prop to model. One prop. You will be taking this prop from concept to completion. Here are some things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pick a prop with at least two materials. This way you can show your ability to handle proper material distinction.</li>
<li>Manage a scope that you can handle. Pick something that will challenge you, but be careful not to bite off more than you can chew.</li>
<li>Pick something that excites you. You want to maintain your motivation and momentum.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 2: Gather Reference</h3>
<p>Gather as much reference as you can. The more real world reference you are working from, the more authentic you will be able to make it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Model your High Poly</h3>
<p>You will be modeling your high poly with a focus on authenticity. During this process, be sure to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proportions</li>
<li>Bevels</li>
<li>Material Distinction</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 4: The Low Poly</h3>
<p>Next you will model your low poly, layout the UVs, and bake it. During this process, pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saving on the straights, spending on the curves</li>
<li>Matching silhouette</li>
<li>Trusting your normal map</li>
<li>Efficient usage of UV space with appropriate texel density</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 5: Texture it</h3>
<p>Once you are happy with your bake, it's time to work the textures. Don't forget the Texture Machine! During this process, pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Color, Value, and Roughness Variations</li>
<li>Useage and Authenticity</li>
<li>Material Distinction</li>
<li>Gradients!</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 6: Render it!</h3>
<p>Presentation is the most important part of a good portfolio piece. For the rendering side, we're going to want to pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Lighting</li>
<li>Photography Effects</li>
</ul>
