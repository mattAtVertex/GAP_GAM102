# Milestone 8:  Low Poly Lesson Plan

<h3><span>Objective</span></h3>
<p><span>In this milestone, your job is to create the low resolution version of your prop. You can do this in any way you deem important.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that topology is still a concern and it is one of those things that will cause problems once you're hired... if you don't put the time in now.&nbsp; That said... it doesn't get you a job.&nbsp; It doesn't buy you a Summer Moon latte.&nbsp; Your texturing and your rendering is what does that.</span></p>
